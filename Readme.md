Readme for PaulSoderlindCode
============================

This repository has the following separate sub projects:

1. JuliaTutorial: a Julia tutorial aimed at finance students

2. JuliaTutorialExtra: the next steps after the JuliaTutorial (debugger, load data, etc)

3. EmpiricalFinancePhD: Julia code for a PhD course in empirical finance at UNISG (unpolished)

4. DriscollKraay: Julia code for panel regressions with Driscoll-Kraay standard errors

5. LStar: Julia code for LSTAR regressions

6. AssetPricingTest: Julia code for asset pricing test



To download use "Download ZIP" (upper right). This gives you a zip file with all the subfolders. (No, as of yet there is no simple way of downloading a single subfolder.)

The code typically follows my lecture notes or papers. So far, there is little error checking.
