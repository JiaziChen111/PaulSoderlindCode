# Introduction

Preliminary Julia code for a Empirical Finance course at UNISG (mainly ported from some old matlab programs). Will improve over time.

The .ipynb files are Julia notebooks. They use data in the Data folder and Julia function in the jlFiles folder. The notebooks are meant to be used together with my lecture notes (pdf files).
