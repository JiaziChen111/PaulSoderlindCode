Readme for EmpiricalFinance
===========================

Preliminary Julia code for a Empirical Finance course at UNISG (mainly ported from some old matlab programs). Will improve over time.

The pdf file is a discussion of how some of the course material (lecture notes on my homepage) can be coded up in Julia.
